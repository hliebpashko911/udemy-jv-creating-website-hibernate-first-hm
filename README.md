# Java + Hibernate Homeworks

This is a very simple homework.  
⚠️ Try to do it by yourself without help or copy-paste.

## Task

1. Add necessary dependencies to `pom.xml` (Hibernate + JDBC driver for your database).
2. Fix `hibernate.cfg.xml` file:
    - Set the correct database URL, username, and password.
    - Configure dialect for your DB.
3. Create `Movie` entity class with at least five fields:
    - Example: `id`, `title`, `director`, `year`, `genre`.
4. Implement a **save operation** in `Main.class` that persists a `Movie` object to the database.

## How to launch

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hliebpashko911/udemy-jv-creating-website-hibernate-first-hm.git
